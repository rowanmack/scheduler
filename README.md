# Interview Scheduler

The Interview Scheduler is easy to use booking application that allows you to view the current calendar, keep up-to-date with availability and book, edit or delete an interview! 

The goal of this project is to create a modern client application using the React view library.

Using the latest tools and techniques, this project was tested following manual, unit, integration and end to end testing methods (including the use of Jest and Cypress among others). 

Focuse was on a single page application (SPA), combining a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience.
